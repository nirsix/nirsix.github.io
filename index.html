							<p>
								With 20 years of experience in automating business processes within financial accounting, sales, production, and logistics, I have developed a deep understanding of these areas. I am skilled at collaborating with other developers and optimizing their code.
                                I have extensive experience in developing, maintaining, and completing legacy projects, including migrating from outdated systems to modern technologies. I have worked on upgrading auxiliary systems and features for legacy projects built with older technology, which has improved their performance and enabled further development.
                                My documented experience includes managing a wide range of databases, from simple to complex, with approximately a thousand active data sets. I focus on ensuring scalability and long-term sustainability in all the projects I work on.
                                I am driven by the company's success and know that my contributions and expertise play a crucial role in achieving these goals.
